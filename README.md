# Acrobot Derivation in Matlab

## Key Files:
- `Derive_acrobot.m` - derivation of equations of motion using Matlab symbolic toolbox.
- `MAIN_passiveSimulate.m` - runs a simulation of the system (as a double pendulum)

## Notes:
All files with the prefix `autoGen_` are created by the symbolic toolbox, and are optimized (non human-readable) code
Every one of these files has another file with a matching name that provides a help file and unpacks the vector and struct inputs.
